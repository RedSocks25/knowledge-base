Exercise Prompt: Playlist Manager

Objective: Create a console application that manages a playlist of songs using a linked list. The application should allow users to perform the following operations:
- Add a Song: Add a new song to the playlist.
- Remove a Song: Remove a specific song from the playlist.
- Reorder Songs: Move a song to a different position in the playlist.

Requirements:
1. Song Representation: Define a Song class with at least the following attributes:
  - title: The title of the song (string)
  - artist: The artist of the song (string)
  - next: A pointer/reference to the next song in the playlist (for the linked list).

2. Linked List Implementation: Implement a Playlist class that supports the following methods:
 - add_song(title: str, artist: str): Adds a song to the end of the playlist.
  - remove_song(title: str): Removes the first song with the given title from the playlist.
  - reorder_song(title: str, new_position: int): Moves the specified song to a new position in the playlist (0-indexed).

3. User Interface: Create a simple console menu that allows users to:
  - Add a song
  - Remove a song
  - Reorder a song
  - Display the current playlist
  - Exit the application

4. Input Validation: Ensure that the application handles invalid inputs gracefully (e.g., trying to remove a song that doesnâ€™t exist, or moving a song to an invalid position).
